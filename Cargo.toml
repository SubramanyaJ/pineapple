# https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/
# Provides a handy error typeo

blake3 = "1"
# https://docs.rs/blake3/latest/blake3/
# A hashing function, based off ChaCha20
# Check if I can parallelize this by the 20th

# chacha20poly1305 = "0.10"
# https://docs.rs/chacha20poly1305/latest/chacha20poly1305/
# The AEAD function used
# Check if I can replace this with AES-GCM and parallelize
aes-gcm = "0.10"
# Maybe I can try exposing the ChaCha20 algorithm I wrote in C first
# to check how this cross porting works
